# FiniteStateMachine
Fun project to implement Finite State Machine

* FSMDriver.java main method is starting point

Assumptions
* Producer can produce an event in one FSM only
* Subscriber can subscribe to any event across FSMs

Yet to be done
* Some of the entities attributes are un used 
* Some optimization like encapsulating FSM within producer , using state entity etc. are yet to be done
